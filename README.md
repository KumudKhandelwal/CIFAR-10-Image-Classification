# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification

-> The dataset is made available via the keras datasets library which contains many sample datasets for learning ML concepts.
-> The number of epochs used are 10 and the model is able to perform the classification. However, this model can be trained better by
  - increasing the number of epochs
  - differently meshing the CNN layers
  - applying data augmentation
  - applying batch normalization
